	<li> Had some fun creating this game in a one week challenge 		with a friend. I used Game maker were he used Unity. Feel free 		to download it. The objective was to create a game in one 		week the theme was Island survival and restrictions was that 		there should be no magic or knights,
	Our motto was "Keep it basic" so don't expect much. 
	Using Game Maker was easy and fun but still time consuming as I 	guess any game development will be.
