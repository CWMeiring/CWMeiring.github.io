I am a creative entrepreneur, artisan, and passionate maker with a deep affinity for design, fandom culture, and handcrafted expression. As the driving force behind Bangarang Crafts and Hearth & Forge Studios, I transform imaginative visions into tangible, high-quality pieces ranging from vibrant tufted rugs and wall hangings to ceramics, 3D prints, and unique home décor inspired by beloved pop culture worlds.

At Bangarang Crafts, I specialize in custom tufting, 3D printing, and home décor offerings, combining texture, colour, and form to craft one-of-a-kind pieces that resonate visually and emotionally.

At Hearth & Forge Studios, I bring fandoms to life—reimagining worlds such as Star Wars, LOTR, Harry Potter, and more—through carefully handcrafted collectibles and décor that bridge artistry and geek culture. 

My mission is to honour the stories that inspire us by creating elegant, meaningful objects that belong in everyday life. I believe that fandoms are not just for childhood—they are sources of joy, identity, and connection, and I aim to integrate them into sophisticated design.

I am driven by curiosity, craftsmanship, and community. Whether working on a commissioned piece or collaborating with fellow creatives through platforms like the Crafters Guild. I strive to deliver quality, originality, and delight in everything I make.
